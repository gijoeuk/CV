## Joe Ingram

Enthusiastic would-be developer looking to make a break from pinstripes and politics. After 10 years of financial services and sales I got to where I wanted. Now looking to move away from big-corporate life and get back to what I loved as a kid; creating and problem solving.

## Skills

#### Communication

My whole career to date has been client-facing and consultative. Often taking complicated technical content and relaying it to non-technical clients in a clear, concise manner. I'm very comfortable in meetings and presentations and think quickly when put on the spot.

- Experience 

For the last 10 years I have been leading business development meetings in front of every type of client imaginable. From tiny one-man start-ups, to C-suite and board-level management of large corporates. I will always adapt to whoever I am dealing with.

- Achievements

The ones that really mean something to me: 

-My wife

-My home

-My friends

-My silly little life

The other stuff: 

-Always been a top seller and made a heap of money for anyone who has ever employed me.

-Finished last role at Moore Stephens achieving 115% of target - £460k in fees. 2nd highest in the UK sales team

-Left role at Leyton UK Partners LLP after one year having generated £250k in one year. No.1 for new fees that year.

-Before that- selling undefloor heating and plumbing components in 2008, the year that everyone stopped building houses. Nonetheless took an inherited base of accounts worth £100k in sales, and turned it into £620k in 2.5 years
